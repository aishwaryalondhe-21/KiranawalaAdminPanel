   - No automatic stock updates on orders yet
   - Consider implementing in Phase 5

4. **Validation:**
   - Client-side validation with Zod
   - Server-side validation via Supabase constraints
   - Price must be positive
   - Stock must be non-negative integer

5. **Product Type:**
   - Updated to match actual schema (category as string)
   - Description and image_url are optional
   - All other fields required
