## 📝 What's NOT in Phase 3

The following features were mentioned in the original Phase 2 document but are deferred:

### Deferred to Future Phases:
- ❌ Pagination (orders load all at once)
- ❌ Print receipt functionality
- ❌ Cancel order with reason modal
- ❌ Add notes to order
- ❌ Order analytics dashboard with charts
- ❌ Order trends visualization
- ❌ Revenue charts
- ❌ Top customers analysis
- ❌ Popular products tracking
- ❌ Sound alerts for new orders
- ❌ Badge counters

### Reason for Deferral:
These features would be better suited for Phase 4 (Analytics & Reports) and Phase 5 (Advanced Features). The core order management functionality is now complete and production-ready.

4. **Stock Management**
   - Low stock alerts
   - Bulk stock updates
   - Stock history tracking

5. **Product Images**

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Real-time Setup:**

   - Toast notifications require Sonner (already installed)

2. **Database Requirements:**
   - `orders` table must have RLS policies
   - `order_status_history` table must exist
   - `order_items` and `products` tables needed for details
   - `customers` table needed for customer info

3. **Phone Number Formatting:**
   - Assumes Indian phone numbers (+91)
   - Can be extended for other countries
   - Validates format before display

4. **Image Optimization:**
   - Uses Next.js Image component
   - Requires proper Supabase Storage setup
   - Images must be publicly accessible
